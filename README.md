Gettext Demo in PHP

This is a reference code for anyone who is interested in using PHP/gettext to support international message string bundle using
portable object (PO) files.

I recommend using POEdit (http://www.poedit.net/) to anyone who would like to get their hands dirty :) 
It's an awesome tool!
